# Portfolio_Website

<ul>
Description:
<ul>
  <li>Portfolio website created to showcase skills as a computer scientist, mainly as a web developer, software engineer, and AI/ML developer. Ideally scalable to the point that adding information is done purely through backend storage (Firebase/SQL/etc.).</li>
</ul>
